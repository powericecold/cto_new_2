## Integration Points

### Data Layer Integration
- Uses `DataStore.getAllTasks()` to fetch tasks
- Uses `DataStore.updateTask(id, updates)` to save due dates
- Respects task filtering (status, type)
- Maintains data consistency across views

### UI Integration
- Follows existing design system and color scheme
- Uses established CSS variables for consistency
- Matches existing component patterns
- Integrates with existing navigation system

### Event System
- Leverages existing drag-and-drop infrastructure
- Extends global `draggedTaskId` variable
- Maintains compatibility with existing drag handlers
- Proper event propagation and prevention

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Minimal DOM manipulation (batch updates)
- Event delegation where possible
- Efficient date calculations
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Touch event throttling
- CSS transitions for smooth animations

### Scalability
- Handles large numbers of tasks per date
- Scrollable task lists within date cells
- Efficient date-based task grouping
- Memory-efficient event listeners

## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Completed Tasks**: Not shown on calendar (by design - calendar is for planning)
2. **Someday/Maybe Tasks**: Not in unscheduled list (by design - intentionally undated)
3. **Task Titles**: Truncated on calendar (by design - space constraints)
4. **Time of Day**: Not supported (only dates, no times)
5. **Multi-day Tasks**: Not supported (only single due dates)
6. **Recurring Tasks**: Not supported in current version

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. Week view mode
2. Agenda/list view for dense dates
3. Color coding by project or priority
4. Multi-day task support (start/end dates)
5. Time-of-day scheduling
6. Recurring task support
7. Calendar export (iCal format)
8. Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
9. Bulk date assignment
10. Calendar print view
11. Task duration tracking
12. Meeting/appointment integration

## Deployment Notes
